# ConeQuest
ConeQuest is the first expert-annotated publicly available dataset for cone segmentation across three different regions on Mars, along with metadata for each sample.

- ConeQuest can be accessed from [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/10077410).

- The ConeQuest dataset has a total of 13,686 patches from 8 different subtiles across 3 regions.

- Metadata of each CTX tile across three regions used in the creation of ConeQuest:

##

### Getting Started

#### Environment Setup

```bash
conda env create -f conequest_env.yml
```

#### Download ConeQuest from Zenodo

```bash
./download_data.sh
```

#### Training and Testing models
Utilize the arguments described in _main.py_ to train and test models for various configurations. A few important arguments are explained below:
- Provide _training_type_ argument 1 or 2 to train a model for benchmarks 1 and 2, respectively.
- In the _training_data_list_, provide a list (string separated with a comma) of region/s or size/s on which model will be trained, e.g., "Isidis Planitia, Hypanis" or "small, medium".
- Use _if_training_positives_ to train your model only on positive samples.

```bash
python main.py \
    --if_training \
    --training_type 1 \
    --training_data_list "Isidis Planitia" \
    --train_model DeepLab
```

- In the _eval_data_, provide which region or size to evaluate.
```bash
python main.py \
    --if_testing \
    --training_type 1 \
    --training_data_list "Isidis Planitia, Hypanis" \
    --train_model DeepLab
    --eval_data Hypanis
```
